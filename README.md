Brainstorming

Things we want to include: 
Account creation and membership levels is a good way to incorporate that social media feel.
Share feature, if possible, is cool.
We could take an idea from the last hackathon concept "Hack the Runway..."
Account creation could use rust enums?? That would be a good way to set user permissions and such.

Yewse Yew instead of javascript for the front end? That or tkinter or some other c++ library that I am unaware of...
